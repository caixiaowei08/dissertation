In recent years, with the rapid developments of society and science, the role that autonomous mobile robots play in people's daily life .It has a wide range of applications in some areas,such as electronics industry、aerospace、automotive production and so on.As human activity space.With the expansion of human activity space,started to hope that autonomous mobile robots can explore unknown space in place of human.researchers envision groups of mobile robots self-organizing
and cooperating to solving some predefined tasks,including exploration of unknown environments,without any central coordinating authority.

According to the specific physical space definition mobile algorithm is the autonomous mobile robot to complete the designated task of the core task, the robot mobile algorithm determines the robot's mobile behavior. The mobile space model evolves into a discrete position model of finite position by the original continuous two - dimensional Euclidean space model. There are three scheduling models for robot movement: FSYNC (Full-synchronous model), semi-synchronous model (ASYNC) and ASYNC (Asynchronous model). In the discrete space model, the minimum motion algorithm, the maximum motion algorithm and other related research results have been used. The verification process of these research questions is the method of manual deduction. However, the manual deduction is not only the process is complicated and the process is Prone to error.Especially for the asynchronous scheduling model, there is a snapshot of the situation, simply can not use the manual deduction of the way to verify the deduction.

The formalization method is gradually used for the verification of various autonomous robot motion algorithms because of its automaticity, rigor and efficiency. Using the DVE formal language to describe the robot movement algorithm, verify that the mobile algorithm satisfies eternity in the model detection tool DiVinE and ITS. At the same time, we use the Muade formal modeling language based on rewriting logic to model the mobile algorithm and verify whether the minimum moving algorithm in the asynchronous scheduling model satisfies the eternal exploration.

In this paper, an autonomous algorithm for autonomous mobile robot space is proposed, which is independent of a specific initial state and is applicable to different scheduling models. At the same time, the efficiency of the symbol model , Which can effectively avoid the state explosion problem.Using the nuXmv symbol model verification tool to explore the robot algorithm in three kinds of scheduling model: complete synchronization model, semi-synchronous model SSYNC, asynchronous model modeling and use LTL formula to define the eternal exploration of the nature of the algorithm, Dynamic verification of the mobile algorithm.Experimental results show that the experimental results show that the symbolic model detects the feasibility of the formal verification of the autonomous mobile robot algorithm and the feasibility of the formal verification of the autonomous mobile robot algorithm under the condition that the initial state is unknown. Efficient.
